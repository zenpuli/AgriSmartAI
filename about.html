    <h1>About Our Project</h1>
    <p>
      <strong>AgriSmart AI</strong> is an innovative initiative by <strong>23BQ1A05I5</strong> designed to empower rural farmers
      with the power of <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong> and <strong>data-driven insights</strong> under the guidance of <strong> Mr. M. Jeevan Babu sir</strong>. 
      This project was developed by <strong>Puli Zeneswari</strong>, a student of 
      <strong>Vasireddy Venkatadri Institute of Technology (VVIT), Guntur</strong>, from the 
      <strong>Computer Science and Engineering Department</strong> (Roll No: <strong>23BQ1A05I5</strong>).
    </p>

    <p>
      The platform predicts <strong>crop yields</strong> by analyzing critical factors such as weather patterns, soil health, and rainfall data. 
      Through intelligent prediction and visualization, AgriSmart AI helps farmers make informed decisions about 
      crop selection, irrigation, and fertilizer management, ultimately improving productivity and profitability.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our mission is to bridge the gap between <strong>technology and agriculture</strong> — bringing cutting-edge 
      AI tools to rural communities in a simple, accessible way. By supporting data-backed decisions, 
      AgriSmart AI contributes to the vision of <strong>sustainable farming</strong> and long-term 
      <strong>food security</strong> for future generations.
    </p>

    <p>
      This project reflects how innovation, when combined with compassion and purpose, 
      can create meaningful impact — transforming traditional farming into a 
      <strong>smarter, sustainable, and technology-driven ecosystem.</strong>
